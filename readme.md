# Python Polygons API

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a robust RESTful API to support shuttle companies in providing their services. One of the challenges faced by shuttle companies is the lack of precise location information, such as zip codes or cities they serve. To overcome this challenge, the project aims to introduce a solution that allows shuttle companies to define custom polygons as their service areas. This approach empowers shuttle company staff to independently define and modify their service areas, allowing them to attribute a fixed price to each polygon.

## Project Objectives:

**1) Build a RESTful API:** Develop an API that enables shuttle companies to interact with the system and manage their service areas efficiently.

**2) Custom Polygon Definition:** Implement a mechanism for shuttle company staff to define custom polygons as their service areas. This flexibility allows them to accurately represent the regions they serve, even in cases where traditional location information is inadequate.

**3) Polygon Modification:** Enable shuttle company owners and administrators to modify the defined polygons as needed. This feature ensures that service areas can be adjusted to reflect changes in business operations or expansion plans.

**4) Pricing for Service Areas:** Associate a fixed price with each defined polygon to provide transparency and clarity to customers. This enables shuttle companies to offer consistent pricing based on the specific service areas they cover.

**5) Scalability and Performance:** Build the API to handle a high volume of requests and ensure fast response times, allowing shuttle companies to retrieve service areas and pricing information swiftly.

**6) Data Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive information, including authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify the service areas and pricing data.

By achieving these objectives, the RESTful API will empower shuttle companies to overcome the limitations of traditional location information. Shuttle company staff will have the flexibility to define and modify their service areas using custom polygons, enabling precise representation of the regions they serve. Additionally, customers will benefit from transparent and consistent pricing based on these defined polygons.
